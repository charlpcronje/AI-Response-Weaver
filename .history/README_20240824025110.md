# **AI Response Weaver**

## **Description**

**AI Response Weaver** is a powerful Python-based application designed to streamline the process of converting AI-generated code blocks into actual files. It allows users to specify a file that contains AI responses, monitors that file for changes, and automatically creates or updates files based on the content. The app intelligently handles various programming languages by using a configurable JSON file to parse file names and relative paths, ensuring that the correct files are created or merged seamlessly. 

AI Response Weaver is ideal for developers working with AI-generated content who want a hands-free, automated approach to integrating code into their projects without manually copying, pasting, and organizing files. With Git integration, error logging, and validation, AI Response Weaver offers a comprehensive solution for managing AI-generated code with precision and efficiency.

## **Features**

- **Automated File Creation:** Converts code blocks in a specified file into actual files, creating the necessary directory structure if it doesn’t exist.
- **File Monitoring:** Continuously monitors a specified file for changes and processes new content automatically.
- **Git Integration:** Automatically creates new branches, overwrites existing files, and triggers merge operations in VS Code for manual resolution.
- **Error Logging:** Logs any validation errors or issues encountered during processing to ensure smooth operation.
- **Configurable File Type Parsing:** Uses a JSON configuration file to handle various file types and comment syntax for parsing file names and paths.
- **Markdown Logging:** Saves each processed response as a markdown file with a timestamped filename for easy reference.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/charlpcronje/AI-Response-WeaverAI Response Weaver.git
   cd AI Response Weaver
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   
     ```bash
     VSCODE_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/code-server
     ```

5. **Set Up Configuration File:**

   - Modify the `config/config.json` file to define file types, extensions, and comment syntax as per your requirements.

## **Usage**

1. **Running the App:**

   To start monitoring a file and specify a log folder, run:

   ```bash
   weaver /path/to/monitored_file.txt /path/to/log_folder/
   ```

   If no arguments are provided and a `.weaver` file exists in the current directory, the app will use the configuration from that file.

2. **Logging and Error Handling:**

   - Processed responses are saved as markdown files in the specified log folder.
   - Any errors encountered during processing will be logged in the `errors/` directory.

3. **Configuring the App:**

   - The app uses a `.weaver` file to remember the last monitored file and log folder. If no `.weaver` file is present, you’ll be prompted to provide the necessary details.
   - The JSON configuration file can be customized to support additional file types or comment syntax.

## **Roadmap**

- **Multi-File Monitoring:** Support for monitoring multiple files simultaneously.
- **Notification System:** Integration with desktop notifications or messaging platforms to alert users of new processed responses.
- **Automated Archiving:** Automatically compress old log files to save disk space.
- **Customizable Templates:** Allow users to define templates for markdown logs.
- **Web Interface:** Develop a web-based interface for managing configurations, logs, and monitoring status.
