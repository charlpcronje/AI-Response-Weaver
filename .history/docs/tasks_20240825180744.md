The application utilizes Flutter for cross-platform development, integrates with RESTful APIs for data management, and incorporates advanced features such as OCR for document scanning and SQLite for local data storage. The app's configuration, including API endpoints and field mappings, is dynamically loaded from remote JSON files, allowing for easy updates and customization without requiring app redeployment.
