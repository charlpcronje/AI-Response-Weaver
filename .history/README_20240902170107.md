# AI Response Weaver

## Description

AI Response Weaver is a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of converting AI-generated code blocks into actual files. It monitors a specified file for changes, parses AI-generated code blocks within that file, and creates or updates corresponding files based on the content. The app intelligently handles various programming languages using a configurable JSON file to parse file names and relative paths, ensuring that the correct files are created or merged seamlessly.

## Features

- **Automated File Creation and Update:** Converts code blocks in a specified file into actual files, creating new files or updating existing ones.
- **Intelligent File Monitoring:** Continuously monitors a specified file for changes and processes new content automatically, skipping already processed content.
- **Git Integration:** Automatically creates new branches for file updates, facilitating version control and conflict resolution.
- **Backup System:** Creates backups of existing files before overwriting them, storing backups in a designated history folder.
- **Configurable File Type Parsing:** Uses a JSON configuration file to handle various file types and comment styles for parsing file names and paths.
- **Detailed Logging:** Generates comprehensive reports of processing activities and saves instruction blocks for reference.
- **VS Code Integration:** Triggers merge operations in VS Code or code-server for manual resolution of conflicts.

## Installation

### Using venv

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Response-Weaver.git
   cd AI-Response-Weaver
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the Package:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Using Conda

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Response-Weaver.git
   cd AI-Response-Weaver
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Conda Environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n ai-weaver python=3.8
   conda activate ai-weaver
   ```

3. **Install the Package:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   VSCODE_EXECUTABLE=code
   # OR
   VSCODE_EXECUTABLE=code-server
   ```

2. **Config File:**
   The `config/config.json` file contains settings for various file types and comment styles. Example structure:
   ```json
   {
     "file_types": {
       "dart": {
         "comment_styles": ["slash"]
       },
       "py": {
         "comment_styles": ["hash"]
       },
       "html": {
         "comment_styles": ["xml"]
       }
     },
     "comment_styles": {
       "slash": ["//", "/*"],
       "hash": ["#"],
       "xml": ["<!--"]
     }
   }
   ```
   To add support for additional file types, update this file accordingly.

## Usage

Run AI Response Weaver using the following command:
```bash
weaver [file_to_monitor] [log_folder]
```

- If run without arguments, it will check for a `.weaver` file in the current directory.
- If no `.weaver` file is found, it will prompt for the file to monitor (default: `weaver.md`) and the log folder (default: `weaver_logs`).
- The `.weaver` file will be created/updated with the current settings for future runs.

## Lifecycle of the Application

1. **Initialization:** Load config, set up file monitoring
2. **File Change Detection:** Monitor specified file for changes
3. **Parsing:** Extract and validate code blocks and instructions
4. **File Operations:** Create new files, prepare updates for existing files
5. **Git Operations:** Create branches, commit changes
6. **VS Code Integration:** Trigger merge operations for conflict resolution
7. **Logging:** Generate reports, create backups, save instruction blocks
8. **Continuous Monitoring:** Return to step 2

## Development

To set up the project for development:

1. Make your changes to the code in the `ai_response_weaver` directory.
2. Test your changes by reinstalling the package:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
