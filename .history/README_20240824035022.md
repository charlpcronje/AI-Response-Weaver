# AI Response Weaver

## Description

AI Response Weaver is a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of converting AI-generated code blocks into actual files. It monitors a specified file for changes, parses AI-generated code blocks within that file, and creates or updates corresponding files based on the content. The app intelligently handles various programming languages by using a configurable JSON file to parse file names and relative paths, ensuring that the correct files are created or merged seamlessly.

## Features

- **Automated File Creation:** Converts code blocks in a specified file into actual files, creating the necessary directory structure if it doesn't exist.
- **File Monitoring:** Continuously monitors a specified file for changes and processes new content automatically.
- **Git Integration:** Automatically creates new branches, overwrites existing files, and triggers merge operations in VS Code for manual resolution.
- **Error Logging:** Logs any validation errors or issues encountered during processing to ensure smooth operation.
- **Configurable File Type Parsing:** Uses a JSON configuration file to handle various file types and comment syntax for parsing file names and paths.
- **Markdown Logging:** Saves each processed response as a markdown file with a timestamped filename for easy reference.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Response-Weaver.git
   cd AI-Response-Weaver
   \`\`\`

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment:**

   \`\`\`bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   \`\`\`

3. **Install the Package:**

   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -e .
   \`\`\`

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a \`.env\` file in the root directory with the following content:

   \`\`\`
   VSCODE_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/code-server
   \`\`\`

   Replace \`/path/to/code-server\` with the actual path to your VS Code executable.

## Usage

To use AI Response Weaver, run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
weaver /path/to/monitored/file.txt /path/to/log/folder
\`\`\`

Replace \`/path/to/monitored/file.txt\` with the path to the file you want to monitor, and \`/path/to/log/folder\` with the directory where you want to store the logs.

## Configuration

The \`config/config.json\` file contains settings for various file types, including their extensions, comment syntax, and regular expressions for parsing file names. You can modify this file to add support for additional file types or change the parsing rules.

## Development

To set up the project for development:

1. Run the \`create_project_structure.sh\` script to create the initial project structure:

   \`\`\`bash
   chmod +x create_project_structure.sh
   ./create_project_structure.sh
   \`\`\`

2. Make your changes to the code in the \`ai_response_weaver\` directory.

3. Test your changes by reinstalling the package:

   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -e .
   \`\`\`
