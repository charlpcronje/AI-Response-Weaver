Create a Python-based application called AI Response Weaver. This app will monitor a specified file for changes, parse AI-generated code blocks within that file, and create or update corresponding files based on the content. The first line of each code block will specify the file name and relative path, which the app will use to ensure the correct files are created. The app should handle multiple file types, each with different comment syntax for detecting file names, as defined in a JSON configuration file.

The app should integrate with Git to manage file overwrites by creating a new branch, overwriting the existing file, and triggering a merge process in VS Code. Additionally, the app should log each processed response as a markdown file, using the current date and time as the file name, and store these logs in a specified folder.

Include a CLI that allows the user to specify the file to monitor and the log folder. If no arguments are provided, check for a `.weaver` configuration file in the current directory and use its settings. If no configuration is found, prompt the user for the necessary details. Add validation and error logging to ensure that responses are correctly formatted before processing.
